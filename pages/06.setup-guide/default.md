## It's as easy as 1-2-3 to get your ePortfolio Blog up and running!

1. Create a Git repository on the Web service of your choice (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in), [BitBucket](BitBucket) or your school's Git service) and copy the HTTPS address of your Git repository to your clipboard.
2. Run the setup wizard for the [GitSync Plugin](../../admin/plugins/git-sync) and follow the provided instructions.
3. And you are done! Visit the Grav [Admin Pages panel](../../admin/pages) to start editing and creating your site page.

Here is a video walkthrough of setting up a ePortfolio Blog, where the Git repository is created while completing the Git Sync wizard.
